## Evidence states and policy separation

Preserve raw measurements and assumptions separately from classification. Use
explicit states such as `measured`, `derived_from_declared_convention`,
`label_only`, `unknown`, `not_requested`, and `not_applicable`.

Only a caller-supplied, hashed policy may classify passivity, closure,
wavelength synchronization, polarization ratio, loss agreement, or mesh gates.
An evidence collector should not silently embed project thresholds.
Default one-point audit output to `evidence_only`; a successful collector is not
a project pass.

## Polarization

Do not infer incident polarization from a port `S/P` label or field maxima inside
a resonator.

Use a lossless all-air clone and sample median or RMS `abs(Ex)`, `abs(Ey)`, and
`abs(Ez)` in a named homogeneous top-air region away from the port and structure.
Persist:

- clone/source/configuration identity;
- sample entity IDs and coordinate range;
- requested/evaluated wavelength and incidence settings;
- aggregation method and component values;
- target/transverse ratios;
- all-air R/T residuals;
- cleanup evidence.

Total field at a reflective physical port is not incident-field evidence. Some
full-field formulations expose background-field variables that evaluate to zero;
verify the formulation before relying on them.
In particular, do not assume `ewfd.Ebx/Eby/Ebz` contains an incident field in a
full-field `PeriodicStructure` model.

For angular claims, test signed elevation in both directions, at least two
azimuth paths, and both polarization labels at sparse normal/intermediate/end
angles. Match the paper/design incidence plane and physical field direction
before comparing peak motion.

## Power closure and material loss

Record raw port R/T/A without clipping. For physical closure, define caller-
declared top and bottom flux planes inside real homogeneous media, with selection
IDs, plane positions, normal/sign conventions, medium identity, expressions, and
units.

Require finite passive R/T/A and compare:

```text
A_flux = 1 - R_flux - T_flux
A_volume = integrated Qh / declared incident power
```

Cross-section absorption and volume loss may agree because they share the same
normalization. Label that comparison `internal_normalization_consistency`; never
use it as a substitute for independent physical flux closure.

Persist per-domain `Qh` for lossy materials. Treat tiny signed values in declared
lossless domains as numerical noise only under an explicit tolerance.

## Wavelength synchronization

Whenever dispersion uses `wl`, record in every row:

- requested wavelength;
- evaluated global `wl`;
- `c_const/ewfd.freq`;
- exact material expressions or their configuration hash.

Diagnose any systematic difference before interpreting spectra.

## Provenance and source integrity

Every row or artifact should include:

- source model relative identity and SHA-256;
- normalized configuration ID;
- requested/evaluated point settings;
- physics, material, mesh, study, dataset, and selection identities;
- mesh expressions and observed element/DOF counts;
- raw R/T/A/flux/loss values and validation state;
- solve time, error, attempt, and durable timestamp;
- script/tool/schema hashes when applicable.

Never mix rows from different geometry, materials, mesh, normalization, or
selection definitions in one configuration. Re-hash the source after clone
cleanup.

For validation matrices, each result row must bind the immutable spec, exact
point fingerprint, collector name, artifact identifier, and wrapper-manifest
hash. Keep full evidence in bounded artifacts; status and list operations return
only bounded summaries.

A successful call is not complete evidence when its manifest is partial,
missing, integrity-blocked, outside the attempt subtree, or inconsistent with
the row. Incidence metadata remains `label_only` unless typed application plus
parent-feature and port readback prove the exact setting used by the solve.

## Reproduction scope and stopping rules

Record the caller's requested evidence tier before scheduling expensive sweeps:

- For a core-mechanism reproduction, require the central spectrum or response,
  contrast between the relevant channels, passive and synchronized raw evidence,
  own-peak mesh convergence at the design point, and sparse signed branch checks
  at normal, intermediate, and endpoint settings on the relevant paths.
- For figure-by-figure reproduction, add only the continuous grids and rendered
  artifacts needed by the named figures.
- For a new or publication-grade claim, add the broader convergence, uncertainty,
  alternative-model, and continuous-domain evidence required by that claim.

Do not make a dense parameter map an automatic acceptance gate. If sparse data
already establish the caller's declared claim, stop or use an offline table or
line plot unless the caller explicitly requests continuous-bandwidth evidence or
figure matching. Conversely, never infer continuous flatness, angular extent, or
branch absence from sparse points. Treat presentation volume and scientific
necessity as separate decisions.

Have a preliminary summarizer report exact artifact identities, raw extrema,
validation failures, and unresolved boundaries. Let a separate reviewer apply
the final acceptance policy; a summary is not itself a scientific verdict.

## Solver choice and effort-ranked follow-up

Choose a solver from the evidence required by the reproduced claim, not from a
preference for one product. For linear periodic scattering, an RCWA result may
serve as the primary or sole reproduction when it uses the exact declared
geometry, materials, incidence, and lattice; reports passive raw `R/T/A`; brackets
each accepted own peak; and converges Fourier orders, shape discretization, peak
amplitude, and linewidth to the caller's tolerance. Label the result as RCWA
reproduction rather than implying that FEM was run.

Require FEM or another volumetric method when the claim depends on quantities
that the selected RCWA implementation cannot validate, such as per-domain loss,
arbitrary three-dimensional or nonperiodic geometry, multiphysics coupling,
specific volume-field slices, or a competing branch that remains ambiguous after
progressive RCWA convergence. Do not rerun a second solver merely for software
uniformity after the requested reproduction tier is already supported.

Rank optional follow-up work by time to decisive evidence:

1. offline parsing, hashes, summary tables, and rejection of stale artifacts;
2. bounded boundary extension, a few next-order points, or a narrow own-peak
   convergence check;
3. a small independent-method bridge or sparse normal/intermediate/endpoint
   branch matrix;
4. broad high-order scans, dense maps, exhaustive uncertainty, and
   publication-grade alternative models.

Estimate total implementation time from measured per-point runtime, the bounded
number of new points, setup/preflight, analysis, and archival work. State
uncertainty when order growth or direct-solver memory scaling is nonlinear, and
re-estimate after the smallest preflight. Prefer the shortest task that closes a
high-impact evidence gap. Stop when the caller's reproduction tier is satisfied;
do not make a dense heatmap, a COMSOL rerun, or a figure-by-figure reconstruction
an implicit requirement.

Keep solver-specific scripts and outputs distinguishable, and mark every branch
or dataset as accepted, diagnostic, superseded, quarantined, or unresolved. A
low-order RCWA non-detection, a scan-boundary maximum, or a fixed-wavelength
amplitude does not justify a negative modal verdict.

## Peak finding and convergence

Use staged discovery:

1. Scan broadly and find every local candidate.
2. Extend if a maximum lies on or near a scan boundary.
3. Refine around each interior bracket.
4. Skip duplicate wavelengths between stages.
5. Save the branch identity and bracket evidence.

For angle sweeps, continue branches from the preceding angle with adaptive
windows. Scan the dominant polarization first; evaluate the suppressed
polarization at each accepted dominant-branch peak. Run a full suppressed scan
only when it is unexpectedly strong or another branch appears.

Compare every mesh at its own bracketed peak. Record fitted center, linewidth,
Q, residuals, baseline rule, threshold, and crossings. Fano, Lorentzian,
absolute-half, and half-prominence widths are not interchangeable. Use identical
spectral support and baseline definition across meshes.

A fixed-wavelength amplitude difference is a diagnostic, not convergence proof.
Adding positive loss cannot increase total Q; if simulated Q is already low,
audit geometry, radiation coupling, mesh, mode assignment, and fit definition.

Run mesh bridges at normal, intermediate, and endpoint angles before generating
a dense angle-wavelength map.

## Field artifacts and visual review

Evaluate field values and coordinates from a solved dataset, validate finite
matching shapes, then select and interpolate a declared slice. Store full arrays
in a bounded artifact such as compressed NPZ and return only hashes, counts,
extrema, component ratios, ranges, coverage, and a bounded sample.

For paired on/off-resonance evidence:

- use identical slice, grid, interpolation, units, and color limits;
- report missing-cell/coverage statistics;
- preserve source/configuration/dataset hashes;
- optionally render PNGs in an isolated plotting process rather than relying on
  headless COMSOL image export.

Numerical code may report ratios. It must not claim mode identity, symmetry,
localization, magnetic character, or publication quality. Require an image-
capable reviewer to confirm receipt of every artifact hash and return structured
observations/uncertainty. Visual review cannot override numerical policy gates.

## Cross-method comparison

Before explaining FEM/RCWA offsets:

1. Compare exact geometry bounds, dimensions, centers, materials/loss signs,
   selections, layer termination, lattice vectors, incidence, wavelength
   controls, mesh/order, and study definitions.
2. Create one immutable common baseline when any difference exists.
3. Run a small bridge matrix around all competing candidates.
4. Verify physical polarization and closure at each bridge point.
5. Refine every branch and compare each method/mesh at its own peak.

Do not let a scattered-field result with nonphysical absorption arbitrate a
physical port/RCWA disagreement.
